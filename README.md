# laCAT
Android application provides UI for useful daily network services

*The* name "laCAT" is an anagram from UNIX application netcat(nc) and abbreviation of local area network(lan)
So laCAT is a local area network concatenate tool.

Whole app was developed without any extra frameworks: every tcp with socket, every icmp with ping
